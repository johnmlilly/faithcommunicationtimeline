The program, sponsored by the Dicastery for Communication, sought to address the challenge of how the Church can and should be present online to adequately respond  to peopleâ€™s spiritual needs, especially given the COVID-19 crisis. Our group of 16 young communicators from Cambodia, Canada, Costa Rica, Italy, Kenya, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States embarked upon a new and exciting journey over the next year together.
